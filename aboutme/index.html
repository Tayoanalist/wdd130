    <h1>Tayo</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone,</p>

    <p> My name is Temitayo Martins, but everyone calls me Tayo. I am looking forward to becoming a Data Analyst or
        anything in a related field. I recently started my journey, and it is one of the major reasons I am back in
        school for my second degree. I love crocheting, baking, volleyball, and drawing, although I have not had
        much time to do any.
    <p>

    <p>I am single, and can't wait to start my own family with a man after God's own heart. I am currently a nail
        technician and a crochet artist. Although I am making a career change to becoming a data analyst, I don't
        plan on leaving my businesses behind. What I love most about BYU-Idaho is the willingness of the instructors
        to teach. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Development.</p>
    <p> In taking this course, I hope to gain practical knowledge in designing and developing websites. In my
        personal life, the knowledge I will gain from this course can help me learn how to create and manage my
        website. Professionally, I'd like my skills to help me pursue freelance or even job prospects in data
        analysis or web design-related roles.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church for 17 years, all through these years there have been some ups and downs,
        I have always found solace within the church. My favorite scripture is Moroni 7:47: "But charity is the pure
        love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be
        well with him." This passage shows me how much Christ's pure love is charity which is everlasting. It tells
        us the importance of emanating Christ-like love for our well-being and salvation.</p>
