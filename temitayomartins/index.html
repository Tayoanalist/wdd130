            <p class="paragraph">My professional journey has been a diverse and enriching experience, starting with my academic 
               background and extending into various roles that have shaped my career. I have a Bachelor's degree 
               in Computer Science from Brigham Young University, Idaho and an Associate's degree in Business 
               Management. My education has provided me with a solid foundation in technical skills, management, 
               and communication, which I have applied in my professional roles.</p>

            <img src="images/temitayo2.PNG" alt="image of Temitayo Martins" class="bottom-left-image">
            <p class="paragraph">My career began with internships and freelance roles that allowed me to explore different industries
               and develop a wide range of skills. As a Communication Liaison at the Research and Business 
               Development Center, I honed my organizational and communication skills by coordinating between our 
               team and clients. This role was instrumental in building my ability to manage projects and events 
               efficiently.</p>
