                <p>
                    Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over 
                    the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children 
                    are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on 
                    a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas 
                    we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you 
                    might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each
                    boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for 
                    very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!

                    The best time for rafting varies depending on the river and the experience you are looking for. Generally,
                    spring and early summer offer higher water levels and more intense rapids, while late summer and fall provide
                    a more relaxed experience with lower water levels and warmer temperatures.

                    feet from the sun. Sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you

                    Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the
                    river. Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful 
                    starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack 
                    your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, 
                    calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after 
                    setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around 
                    camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled 
                    salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more 
                    relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to 
                    bed under more stars than you thought were possible.
